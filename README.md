# A Real-Time Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard with Dash, Plotly, and Flask on Google Colab


## Objective 

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard that allows users to easily upload CSV/XLSX files and create various types of charts and graphs. This tool aims to empower users with minimal programming knowledge to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate insightful visualizations using a user-friendly interface.

## Scope

### This project encompasses the following key features:

 File Upload:  Users can upload CSV or XLSX files directly through the interface.

 Dynamic Chart Selection: Users can select different types of charts, including scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and more, based on their data needs.

Customizable Axes: Users can choose columns from their dataset for the X and Y axes, enabling tailored visualizations.

Interactive Interface: The dashboard provides an intuitive, interactive interface for real-time data visualization.

Real-time Visualization: Users can see the changes in their visualizations immediately after selecting different chart types or data columns.

Deployment: The dashboard is hosted on Google Colab and accessible via an Ngrok URL, making it easy to share and access from anywhere.

## This project is ideal for data analysts, researchers, and anyone looking to quickly visualize data without extensive coding.
 
 ## ðŸ“Š Key Features:

File Upload: Users can upload data files (CSV or XLSX) directly through a user-friendly interface.

Dynamic Dropdowns: Based on the uploaded data, users can select columns for the X-axis and Y-axis to customize their visualizations.

Chart Options: The platform offers a variety of chart types to choose from, allowing for flexible data exploration.

Visualization: The tool uses Plotly for generating high-quality, interactive charts that can be tailored to the userâ€™s needs.

Flask Integration: The platform is hosted using a Flask server, making it highly scalable and easy to deploy.

Ngrok Integration: To make the platform accessible from anywhere, I integrated Ngrok, allowing the Dash app to be securely hosted and accessible via a public URL in Google Colab.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

Python: The backbone of the project.

Dash & Plotly: For building the interactive user interface and visualizations.

Flask: To host the Dash app.

Ngrok: For secure tunneling and public access.
